    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <p>
      My primary stack includes PHP, Go and Typescript but I have used a variety of other languages and tools over the years out of necessity or out of curiosity. Here are some of the tools I have used and am comfortable with, there are a lot not on this list that I have school-related experience with or have no interest in generally working with again.
    </p>

      {
        tools.map((tool) => (
          <li class="w-full flex items-start gap-3">
            <div
              class="w-10 min-w-10 aspect-square object-cover flex items-center justify-center rounded-md mt-1 md:mt-0"
              style={{ backgroundColor: tool.color }}>

      I am always interested in trying out new things, just to see how they suck and how they are better than my current tools, if you have any suggestions or anything that excites you, feel free to @ me on Twitter/X!
