# What is this article?

This is the second article in an unofficial series I am calling "TOL" (for **Thinking Out Loud**) where I don't try to sell you anything, convince you to change your ways or anything like that, I will just talk about my thoughts regarding some things. This post was initially going to be about what I thought were the cons of the `try-catch` exception and error control flow used in most C-style langauges and why you may want to look at, appreciate or even switch to alternatives but it would be extremely negative and dishonest to just present that one side. Instead, this will be one long article about how I have used `try-catch`, why it can be good and why I think it can "harmful" (as with every other thing in life). This article may go against your beliefs and your beliefs may go against mine, that is fine, as the series title says, this is my subjective opinion that I am simply thinking out loud, I urge you to accept this instead of taking it as a spit in the face of your favorite language or programming culture, I would appreciate a constructive and productive discourse if you so desire.
