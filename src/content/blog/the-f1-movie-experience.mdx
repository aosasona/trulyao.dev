I saw [F1 The Movie](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_(film)>) almost two months ago in June. I had just "finished" Uni and in between that and going back to working full-time in July, I had a lot of free time to catch up on other things I hadn't been able to for the last few months - I just really needed the... reset.
I mainly did two things when I wasn't sleeping or forced to do other things; writing software and consuming visual media; mostly older and longer TV shows from the Supernatural era. Although, these days, I am pretty much into bodybuilding as a sport and working out too, so that would be _three_ things I suppose. I am not a sports person, I am not much of an anything person actually, they just don't interest me, I'd rather do other things with my time.
