# Obligatory introductory wall of text; otherwise ~~known~~ disguised as context

I saw [F1 The Movie](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_(film)>) almost two months ago in June. I had just "finished" Uni (dissertation and final exams) and in between that and going back to working full-time in July, I had a _lot_ of free time to catch up on other things I hadn't been able to for the last few months - I just really needed the... reset.

I used to mainly do two things when I wasn't forced to do other things; writing software and consuming visual media; mostly older and longer TV shows from the [Supernatural](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460681/) era (and genre). Although, these days, I am pretty much into bodybuilding as a sport and working out too, so that would be _three_ things I suppose. I am not a sports person, I am not much of an anything person actually; unless it's computers, or technology, or some fascination with the human mind, they just don't interest me, I'd rather do other things with my time.

Admittedly but not unfortunately, I live in a sort of bubble because of that, and I am usually fine with it, I enjoy these things, I am trying out some new things and picking up some old things again in the future; like drawing. All of this is to say, I had **ZERO** idea what Formula 1 really was, or why this ["Lewis Hamilton"](https://www.formula1.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton) was a major marketing point for this movie; when I say ZERO, I really mean ZERO.

> All I knew about motorsports was "They drive kinda fast in a loop and a lot of people seemingly pretend they like it". You would be surprised how much "normal people" stuff or trend I have no clue about, which is both a blessing, and a curse.

The trailer for this movie somehow landed on my screen, I saw it was an Apple Studios movie and I like all of their stuff I have seen so far, so why not? I already had a Cineworld Unlimited subscription with a plan to go to the movies (by myself) as many times as I could to truly enjoy these movies. I didn't even care about the story, or that it was a sport movie, I also hadn't seen any of Top Gun movies, so the director wasn't a major selling point for me either, the only familiar names were Jerry Bruckheimer and Brad Pitt; but they didn't sell me on it either.

Honestly, this was a movie I would have skipped but I was actively looking to spend more time outside (or technically, at the cinema) and I trust Apple's production quality from all the other ones I have seen so far, so I decided to see it... three times, and ended up becoming a Rookie F1 fan and sim racer.
